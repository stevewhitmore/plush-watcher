# Plush Watcher

This project exists because my kid REALLY likes the Warriors book series and the publisher sells swag. One of the things they sell are plushy cat doll things that sell like hot cakes and are nearly always out of stock. This little project crawls their website and alerts me when one is found to be in stock.

Project requires a `.muttrc` in its root directory to send emails through Googles SMTP server. As a result there is no prebuilt Docker image available.
